# MPEG-CoDec
1. For a demonstration of the CoDec, execute the python file 'run.py'
- Libraries: Install the latest-compatible versions of the libraries NumPy & OpenCV. Also, install Matplotlib.
- Input: The video file titled 'xylophone1.wm' must be in the same directory.
- Time: The execution time is about 80 seconds, on the processor i5-11357G7 (2.4 GHz) and the graphics card 'NVIDIA GeForce MX450'
2. To understand the theory of an MPEG codec, read the file titled 'report.pdf'.
3. To know the problem statement, read the file titled 'assignment.pdf'
4. I have excluded the subroutines for run-length encoding, to hasten the computation for a demonstration.
